## About Project Blue
Project Blue is a professional web platform designed to showcase my work as a software developer and provide a space for collaborators to feature their projects as well.  

The site will serve as:

## Vision
The goal of Project Blue is to combine professionalism with creativity:  
- Present my career, skills, and values in a clear and engaging format.  
- Offer interactive examples of software I’ve built, ranging from web apps to experimental tools.  
- Build a living platform that evolves as I grow as a developer.  

## Highlights
- 🌍 Centralized personal and collaborative portfolio.  
- 🔧 Deployed web applications demonstrating practical skills.  
- 👥 Contributor pages showcasing team members and joint projects.
